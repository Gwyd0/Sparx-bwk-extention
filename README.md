# Sparx Bwk
**Note: This project is still in beta and is buggy**

**Sparx-Bookwork-Code (Sparx-BWK)** is a project I've been working on for about a year (mostly as a hobby and because I'm lazy).

It's a Firefox extension to log Bookwork codes for Sparx and auto completes Bookwork checks (explained [here](https://support.sparx.co.uk/docs/what-are-bookwork-checks)). Its original design was a web scraper using Chrome driver to log bookwork codes and auto complete bookwork checks. The original code is [here](https://github.com/Gwyd0/Sparx-bwk). This newer version is not only more efficient but easier to install as it is a web browser extension rather than a web scraper.

Having it here may help anybody who wants to somewhat automate their Sparx maths homework. (or just hates writing bookwork codes)
